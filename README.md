# ECE-9163-MLCS-Project
Final Project of 2021 Fall ECE-9163 MLCS, finished alone by Rong Yue

You could just run all 4 programs on colab separately(each of them might cost much RAM and I used colab pro.)
The code was commented in detail and all the datasets and models will be downloaded automatically into colab when you run the code.

The repaired models are in /models and you could evaluate them directly. Actually I have already run the eval.py on them in my code.
